## Merge Request Integration

Merge Request Integration is a plugin which helps you to do Code Review right in your IDE.

What you can do:

- Filter Merge Requests which are assigned to you, waiting for your approval, etc
- Check pipeline status and approval status.
- Do code review, navigate code with Diff View right in your IDE.
- Add and reply a comment
- Approve/revoke your approval
- More and more features will be coming soon :)

Currently the plugin supports GitLab only (gitlab cloud and self-hosted).

- Log in to your Gitlab site
- Go to Settings > Access Token and create a personal access token
- Go to your IDE preferences, Merge Request Integration > Gitlab
- Fill data, then save and click refresh button of Merge Request Integration CE window

It's totally free if you are using it for public repositories.

For private repositories, this plugin is a trial. How long is the trial period? Equal to WINRAR's trial period 🙈

Community Edition (CE) is exactly the same as Enterprise Edition (EE). 
You don't need to hack or find a cracked version.
Cracking software invites virus to your computer.
